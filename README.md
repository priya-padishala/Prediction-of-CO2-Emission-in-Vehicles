Our personal vehicles are a major cause of global warming. Collectively, cars account for 
nearly one-fifth of all emissions, emitting around 24 pounds of carbon dioxide and other 
global-warming gases for every gallon of gas. About five pounds comes from the 
extraction, production, and delivery of the fuel, while the great bulk of heat-trapping 
emissions—more than 19 pounds per gallon—comes right out of a car’s tailpipe. It is 
assumed the average gasoline vehicle on the road today has a fuel economy of about 22.0 
miles per gallon and drives around 11,500 miles per year. Every gallon of gasoline burned 
creates about 8,887 grams of CO2. The CO2 emissions on the road from new cars were 
around 203g/km. A typical passenger vehicle emits about 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
annually. This number can vary based on a vehicle’s fuel, fuel economy, and miles driven 
per year. The higher the number of controlled and uncontrolled effect variables influencing 
the CO2 properties, the lesser the predicted accuracy. Despite this, a few experimental 
designs have been suggested by considering the controllable effect variables and interaction 
terms between them. To predict the emission of gas from a car we develop a model that 
uses the car's attributes to specify whether the car has exceeded the threshold value of CO2, 
if it exceeds the threshold then RTA will seize that car.
